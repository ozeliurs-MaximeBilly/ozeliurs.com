<p>As a holiday project I wanted to know why so many ip adresses tried to connect to my personnal server. In the quest of truth I stumbled on Cowrie, a linux program that captures ssh sessions and allows us to analyse the ssh traffic to our machine.</p>
<p>For installation you can install the app on docker which eases the install process. You can find info <a href="https://github.com/cowrie/docker-cowrie">here</a>. Otherwise you can install it normally on your machine with the help of <a href="https://cowrie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html">this guide</a>.</p>
